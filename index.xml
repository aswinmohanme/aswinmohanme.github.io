      <title>Turning Off Syntax Highlighting</title>

      <description>Few weeks back I stumbled on this blog post which stated the obvious benefits of disabling syntax highlighting for your code. I would have been surprised if I hadn&#39;t read this one before. Both the blog posts advocate disabling colors schemes completely or minimally.
At the outset this seems absurd for anyone who has been coding for any length of time and insane for the cool kids who started learning to code in the age of color monitors.</description>

      <title>On Writing on the Internet</title>

      <description>It&#39;s been a long time since I have written some long form content, and it&#39;s starting to show. The ability to write shows the ability of the mind to sit down and focus. Lately it has been hard to write something down, focus seems to be all over the place. That is hardly surprising given the amount of time I spent on my smartphone.
As important as the writing itself is the Medium(pun intended) and how much control you have over it.</description>
