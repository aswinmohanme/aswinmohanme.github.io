      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I have written some long form content, and it&amp;rsquo;s starting to show. The ability to write shows the ability of the mind to sit down and focus. Lately it has been hard to write something down, focus seems to be all over the place. That is hardly surprising given the amount of time I spent on my smartphone.
As important as the writing itself is the Medium(pun intended) and how much control you have over it.</description>

      <description>Lisp is awesome, lisp can make you the 10x programmer, Lisp is the Hero we need
 I have been reading about Lisp for some time now, and wherever I look and whatever I read there is always entire essays dedicated to lisp, how it&amp;rsquo;s awesome, how it can make you a better programmer, how it can solve world hunger given the chance.
Lisp is a pretty old programming language, the second oldest still in use after fortran.</description>
