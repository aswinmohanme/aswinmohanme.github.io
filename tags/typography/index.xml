      <description>Either you love gorgeous typography or just don&amp;rsquo;t care. If you are the former read ahead on how to make the font rendering on your Linux look just as awesome as that on macOS, else read on to find out what beauty you have been missing.
I switched to a hackintosh for a while and fell in love with how beautiful the typography was. After returning to Linux and some fiddiling around I came across a not so ugly setup that looked close enough to macOS.</description>

      <description>Whenever I wanted new fonts Google Fonts was the defacto place I&amp;rsquo;d go to. It has a ton of great fonts and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to add to your projects. They are also hosted for free by Google which takes some load of your own webserver. I had a personal collection of favorite fonts that I cycle through on new projects.
Everything was going nice when I found out Inter. It was free, looks really crisp and was not available on Google Fonts :(.</description>
