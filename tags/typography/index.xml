      <description>Whenever I wanted new fonts Google Fonts was the defacto place I&#39;d go to. It has a ton of great fonts and it&#39;s fairly easy to add to your projects. They are also hosted for free by Google which takes some load of your own webserver. I had a personal collection of favorite fonts that I cycle through on new projects.
Everything was going nice when I found out Inter. It was free, looks really crisp and was not available on Google Fonts :(.</description>
