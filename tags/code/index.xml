      <description>Whenever I wanted new fonts Google Fonts was the defacto place I&amp;rsquo;d go to. It has a ton of great fonts and it&amp;rsquo;s fairly easy to add to your projects. They are also hosted for free by Google which takes some load of your own webserver. I had a personal collection of favorite fonts that I cycle through on new projects.
Everything was going nice when I found out Inter. It was free, looks really crisp and was not available on Google Fonts :(.</description>

      <title>Turning Off Syntax Highlighting</title>

      <description>Few weeks back I stumbled on this blog post which stated the obvious benefits of disabling syntax highlighting for your code. I would have been surprised if I hadn&amp;rsquo;t read this one before. Both the blog posts advocate disabling colors schemes completely or minimally.
At the outset this seems absurd for anyone who has been coding for any length of time and insane for the cool kids who started learning to code in the age of color monitors.</description>
